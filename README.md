# My Portfolio

Hi ! 
This is the front-end interface of my portfolio.
As I'm still learning a lot of things about Best Practices and Architecture, please feel free to suggest me improvements.
There will be new features/improvements as soon as I got time for it (such as unit testing, ES6 review, better component architecture and so on).
See ya and have a nice coding day ;)
